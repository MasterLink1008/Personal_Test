# Personal_Test
This is an AI I made to test my self with no tutorials and minimal documentation. I started by finding a random AI dataset then
researched how to know if you need to use regression or classification on different datasets and
established that this one needed calssification because it had classes (I thought it would be harder to choose)
anyway I chose SVM for my classification model and made it.
